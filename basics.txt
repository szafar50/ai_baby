💡 If your goal is free GPU time for learning Ollama / LLaMA models, GitHub won’t replace Colab or RunPod.
But if your goal is free cloud coding environment to write and test backend code while connecting to a remote Ollama server, Codespaces could help.

If you want, I can give you a setup where your backend runs in GitHub Codespaces, but calls Ollama hosted for free on Google Colab.
That way, you’d get both:

Free cloud IDE (GitHub Codespaces)

Free GPU (Colab)

That would make your local hardware irrelevant.

Do you want me to make that combined setup?

Ollama provides a local HTTP server (running on http://localhost:11434) that exposes an API to interact with models like Mistral.

If issues are found, you’ll see warnings/errors. Fix them manually or use npm run lint -- --fix (if supported) to auto-fix some issues.

4. Common Scenarios and Frameworks
The exact behavior of npm run dev depends on your project’s framework or setup. Here are examples:

Next.js:
"dev": "next dev" starts a server at http://localhost:3000 with hot-reloading.
No need for npm run lint to start the server.
Vite:
"dev": "vite" starts a fast development server (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
Linting is separate and optional.
React with Create React App:
"dev": "react-scripts start" starts the server at http://localhost:3000.
Linting may be built into the dev process, but npm run lint is still separate.
Node.js/Express:
"dev": "nodemon server.js" starts a Node.js server with auto-restart on changes.
Linting is optional and separate.

Because in your code, you're not using real Llama — you're using a fake name mapped to distilbert.

In main.py, you have:

python


1

⌄
MODEL_MAPPING = {
    "Llama": {"use": "distilbert", "style": "direct, open, and technical"},
    ...
}
So when the frontend sends "Llama" as a model name, the backend uses distilgpt2 (via distilbert pipeline) to generate a fake response.
